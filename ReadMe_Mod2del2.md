# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is help Steve analyze DAQO and other funds performance to present to his client if DAQO is good choice to invest money. The analysis will also  help to see other funds performance to see which stocks has good return investment.


## Results
Two years return invesment comparison shows that in 2017 out of 12 stocks, only 1 has a negative return value. In 2018 majority of the stocks went down drastically. 2018 stocks performed poorly compared to 2017. Refactored codes was used on this challenge. The first code was only to be able to get data for a  specific year. Refactored codes we now have a choice to get either 2017 or 2018 data in one script. We changed the internal structure but did not changed the external structure.

## Summary

### Advantage and disadvantage of regfactoring code
- Refactoring code is to improve internal structure of existing program's code not affecting the external structure. It will allow you to modify code that will cater or will work for your needs and it is eaier to read and makes debugging process go smoothly. It reduces the chance of system to seriously broken during restructuring. Refactoring code is not always a good choice to do. Refactoring code takes time. You need time to test the validity of codes. It slows down the development and prone to defects.

### Advantage and disadvantage of the original and regfactored code
- Original code is step by step process, longer script, and sometimes manual counting or visualization is required. Refactored codes are easy to read and not a lot of scripts to write. 

- Refactored codes though can be time consuming or takes long time to debug if it fails or broken. It will take a lot of time to test and slows down development of project. Refactoring codes is good if you have plenty of time to work on script. If you have a deadline of the project it is not advisable use refactored codes.
